Item Editor for Minecraft Bedrock

You can:
1. Make an Item template and use this to forge new items with/without lore and enchantments
2. Set or clear Can Place On and Can Destroy
3. Inspect personal inventory (work in progress)
4. Generate artifacts (work in progress - two modes currently: bunch of random enchanted loot, and a personalised kit of equipment)

This is in active development. Your ideas and comments are welcomed.

Areas under construction:
1. Item inspection - detail page, and enabling dynamic results
2. Multiplayer: Current implementation is with a global guidebook, subject to collisions between players using the book at the same time
3. Programmer art
