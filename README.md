Item Editor for Minecraft Bedrock

You can:
1. Make an Item template and use this to forge new items with/without lore and enchantments
2. Inspect personal inventory (work in progress)
3. Generate artifacts (work in progress - two modes currently: bunch of random enchanted loot, and a personalised kit of equipment)

This is in active development. Your ideas and comments are welcomed.
